# StarboxIo2025

This is the front end part of a simple barista or drink dispensing application. It is written with Angular (https://angular.dev/)

This Angular front end uses a .NET backend WebAPI and Sql Server. It uses template forms and reactive forms in various components. It uses RxJS to communicate with the back end.

The backend can be found in this repository: https://github.com/dougbean/StarboxNet8CoreApiEF	

The requirements document is here - https://github.com/dougbean/StarboxNet8CoreApiEF/blob/main/StarboxLibraryNet8EF/Docs/Starbox.pdf

I followed the requirements more or less, though I used .NET for the back end rather than Ruby on Rails or Groovy on Grails.

The requirements document is a code challange presented to job applications of my former employer. I did it to practice and to learn new technologies, such as Angular and React.

Run npm install to install the node packages.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
