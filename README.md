# StarboxIo2025

This is a front end part of a code challange to build a barista application. It was for developers applying to my previous company.

I used it to learn and practice technologies like AngularJS and then Angular.io.

This Angular version uses a .NET backend WebAPI and Sql Server. It uses template forms and reactive forms in various components. It uses RxJS to communicate with the back end.

Run npm install to install the node packages.

The backend can be found in this repository:
https://github.com/dougbean/StarboxNet8CoreApiEF

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
